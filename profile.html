<p>Improve Your Quality Of Life


There are many benefits of regular exercise and physical activity such as risk reduction of having a heart attack, <br>


diabetes, high cholesterol, blood pressure, or reduction of bone density.<br>


Beyond these health related factors, a sound fitness program may help improve other intangibles like your overall self-confidence,<br>


mental focus, energy levels, and overall quality of life (i.e.keeping up with the kids and intimacy with your significant other).</p>

<h2></h2>ABOUT ME</h2>


My passion for fitness began with my own life experience back in 2010 as i completed highschool.<br>


Like many young people, I thought I could eat anything I wanted and not be affected until my bad habit of consuming a lot of foods caught up with me as my clothes began to fit more snug than I was comfortable with. Besides having an expanding waistline, I was frequently tired and maintained a low energy level and required the assistance of 5 Hour Energy drinks to give me the boost I needed to make it through the day. Up until this point, healthy eating and physical activity never crossed my mind, and I had no clue (because I was uneducated) that my body was behaving in the manner that it was because I was not caring for it appropriately. A pair of pants ripping while bending over to put on my shoes marked the beginning of my fitness journey toward a new me. Because I desired to look and feel better, I was compelled to find the answers about how to do just that.<br>


But finding the right answers usually start with asking the right questions. In the beginning, I wanted to know how I could lose weight fast, so the only answers I cared to receive were of the quick results variety. I tried several of the popular weight loss fads that included juicing, colon cleanses, and various diets. I never asked if these methods were safe, effective long-term, or appropriate for my goals. I also did not ask if it was ok for me to continue eating foods that put the pounds on in the first place. You see, I wanted to experience a change without changing. I wanted these weight loss gimmicks to shed pounds off me without the need for me to give up the sweets I enjoyed or requiring that I engage in any physical activity. In other words, I wanted to remain complacent and stuck in who I was and take short-cuts and cheat the process. This was just the beginning of my journey and though I had a desire for change in my life, that desire was not yet strong enough because I continued to do the things that jeopardized any hope I had for weight loss.<br>


The quick results tactics were not the answer and proved ineffective.</p>
